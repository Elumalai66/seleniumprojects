• When the user refreshes the page or navigates into new page, DOM changes then the 
WebElement goes stale.
• If we try to reuse the WebElement that became stale we will get 
StaleElementReferenceException.
• To avoid this exception, we can implement POM framework.

What is mean by following,sibling,child,parent,preceding in Xpath?
Following: *denotes the immediate next element of the current node.
sibling: *denotes the following siblings of the context node. Siblings are at the same level of 
the curren t node .

For checking the broken links, you will need to do the following steps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Collect all the links in the web page based on <a> tag.
• Send HTTP request for the link and read HTTP response code.
• Find out whether the link is valid or broken based on HTTP response code.
• Repeat this for all the links captured.
107.What is framework, why we go for framework?
• Famework is a code structure that helps to make code maintenance easy.
• Without frameworks, we will place the “code” as well as “data” in the same place which is 
neither re-usable nor readable.
• Using Frameworks, produce beneficial outcomes like increased code re-usage, higher 
portability, reduced script maintenance cost, higher code readability, etc.
108.What is the difference between get() and navigate()?
• If we use get() method, it is used to launch the given url and get() method will wait till the 
page loads completely
• If we use navigate() method, we can perform back(), refresh() and forword() action since it 
stores browser cookies and navigate() method will not wait till the page loads completel
