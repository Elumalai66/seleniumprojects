 1. What is OOPs Stands for?

  OOPs Stands For Object Oriented Programming. And it is a procedural language.
          The Four types of OOps Concepts are:
            *   Polymorphism
            *   Encapsulation
            *   Inheritance
            *   Abstraction  


 2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?

 In java, We can perform a single action in multiple ways is called polymorphism.
          There are two Types:
            * Method Overloading 
                  -> It has same class name, same method name but different arguments are passed is called Method overloading.
                  -> It is a Compile Time polymorphism.
                  -> And this is Static polymorphism.
                   ex:   System.out.println(x);  =>here we declare multiple datatype for the variable x so it is realtime example for method overloading.

            * Method Overriding
                  -> It has different class name and same method name from the existing class is called as method overriding.
                  -> It is a Run Time Polymorphism.
                  -> And this is Dynamic polymorphism.
                   ex:    SetFileDetector();  =>This is used to set the file path for manually download the driver.


   3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
      
        Interface is a blue print of class.
        Interface is used to achieve abstraction. In interface we can't create an object and instantiate variable.
        In a interface we can use only public access modifier or default. And it have unimpleted methods only.
          Ex.)
              Webdriver is an interface in selenium
              WebDriver driver=new WebDriver();


   4.what is abstarct class and example?
        Abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be create a object. To access the abstract class, it must be inherited from other class.
              Ex.)
                  public abstract class CollegeName{
                    public void name()
                    {
                      System.out.println("PSNAcet");
                    }
                    public abstract void department();
                   }


   5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance?

   Multiple Inheritance:
              -> One class Inherit more than one interface or class in a same class is called multiple inheritance.

            Multi-Level inheritance:
              ->  One base class is derived from other class, The derivered class is a base class to inherit some other class is called as multi level inheritance.
              ->  It can use in a class level inheritance in java.


   6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?

           -> In java class level, mutiple inhertance are not allowed because of ambiguity or conflict.
           -> Multiple inheritance is allowed only in interface level.


   7.What is the keyword for using inheritance  ?

            extends is the keyword, is used to inherit the properties of the class.


   8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class?

             implements is the keyword, to access the interface it must be implemented by the class with the implemented methods.
       The body of the interface method is provided by the implemented class.


   9.what is difference between class and interface?

  Class:
        ->  The class must be instantiated.
        ->  Class can create a object.
        ->  Class does not support multiple inheritance.

  Interface:
         ->  The interface can not be instantiated.
         ->  Interface can not create a object.
         ->  It allows Multiple inheritance.


   10.what is difference between class and abstract class?

          Abstract class:
            ->  Abstract class contains both the implemented and unimplemented methods

          Class;
            ->  Class contains only the implemented methods.
