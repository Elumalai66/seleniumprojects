1. What is inheritance?

ANS   : Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes. 
        In Java, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
        The class that inherits the properties is known as the sub-class or the child class.
        
2. What are the types of inheritance?

ANS   : There are three types of inheritance in java: Single, Multilevel and Multiple.
       Single: Multilevel and Multiple.

        Multiple and Hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.Hierarchical
        
3. What are the advantages in inheritance?

ANS   : * Code Reusability
        * Easy to maintanance
        * Effective memory management
        
        
4. example for selenium ? 

ANS   :
        Selenium is an open source automation testing tool which is used to test web applications.
       • Selenium testing tool consists of different set of tools in it like 
         Selenium WebDriver, 
         Selenium RC, 
         Selenium IDE.
       • which has different features.
       
        Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an         internal tool at Thought Works. Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.

        ex:   Child Class           Parent Class
                   |                    |
            * ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
            * ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
            * RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver
            * WebDriver extends SearchContext
            * Interface SearchContext
            
5.Difference between Array and ArrayList ?

ANS   : In Java, array and ArrayList are the well-known data structures. An array is a basic functionality provided by Java, 
   where as ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It belongs to java.util package. 
     Array :
           Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
           To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
        
     ArrayList :
          Arraylist is collection of similar datatypes .
          It is Rapper class.
          It follows index positions to store the value.
          It is a length is dynamic.
          we can change its size.
             
   LinkedList :
          Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
          It provides a linked-list data structure.
          It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
          
 6. What is string in Java with example?

          In Java, a string is a sequence of characters.
          strings in Java are not primitive types (like int, char, etc). 
          Instead, all strings are objects of a predefined class named String.
          
 7. What is the difference between string and StringBuffer in Java?

    String:
          String is a sequence of characters. 
          In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.
          Its a non primitive data type.
          
    StringBuffer:
          A string buffer is like a String, but can be modified. 
          It contains some particular sequence of characters, but the length and content of the sequence can be changed through certain method calls.
  
  StringBuilder :
          Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String. 
          The Java StringBuilder class is same as StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized.
     
    Manual Testing :
           In manual testing , test cases are executed manually without any support from tools or scripts.
               
    Automaion Testing :   
            Automation testing  is using test cases are executed with the assistance of tools scripts and software.
