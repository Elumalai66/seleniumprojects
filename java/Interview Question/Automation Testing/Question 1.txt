1. What is inheritance?

ANS   : Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes. 
        In Java, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
        The class that inherits the properties is known as the sub-class or the child class.
        
2. What are the types of inheritance?

ANS   : There are three types of inheritance in java: Single, Multilevel and Hierarchical.

        Multiple and Hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.
        
3. What are the advantages in inheritance?

ANS   : * Code Reusability
        * Easy to maintanance
        * Effective memory management
        
        
4. example for selenium ? 

ANS   : Selenium is a open source tool for automation testing.
        ex:   Child Class           Parent Class
                   |                    |
            * ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
            * ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
            * RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver
            * WebDriver extends SearchContext
            * Interface SearchContext
            
5.Difference between Array and ArrayList ?

ANS   : In Java, array and ArrayList are the well-known data structures. An array is a basic functionality provided by Java, 
   where as ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It belongs to java.util package.   
   
   Array:
       Array is a group of same data types.
       An array is a dynamically-created object.
       It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values of the same type.
       It has a contiguous memory location. 
       Once an array is created, 
       we cannot change its size.
        
   ArrayList :
          Arraylist is collection of similar datatypes .
          It is Rapper class.
          It follows index positions to store the value.
          It is a length is dynamic.
          we can change its size.
             
   LinkedList :
          Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
          It provides a linked-list data structure.
          It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
          
 6. What is string in Java with example?

          In Java, a string is a sequence of characters.
          strings in Java are not primitive types (like int, char, etc). 
          Instead, all strings are objects of a predefined class named String.
          
 7. What is the difference between string and StringBuffer in Java?

    String:
          String is a sequence of characters. 
          In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.
          
    StringBuffer:
         
          A string buffer is like a String, but can be modified. 
          It contains some particular sequence of characters, but the length and content of the sequence can be changed through certain method calls.
