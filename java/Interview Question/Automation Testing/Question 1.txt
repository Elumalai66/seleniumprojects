5.Difference between Array and ArrayList ?

ANS   : In Java, array and ArrayList are the well-known data structures. An array is a basic functionality provided by Java, 
   where as ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It belongs to java.util package.   
   
   Array:
       An array is a dynamically-created object. It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values of the same type. It has a contiguous memory location. Once an array is created, we cannot change its size.
        
   ArrayList :
          Arraylist is collection of similar datatypes .It follows index positions to store the value.It is a length is dynamic.we can change its size.
