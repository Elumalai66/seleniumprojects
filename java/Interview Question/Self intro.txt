It's my pleasure to introduce myself to you. -

My Advantage is i regularly practice programing like everyday but still the disadvantage is the daily practice is not enough for myself so i have to push myself more i still need more practice. 
I like to take challenges and learn new things to help my career.
My Goal is I would like to become successful in my profession.
I like to play cricket and Traveling
That's all about me sir.


I've worked hard in my education and now I'm ready to apply my knowledge into practice. While I don't have any real-life work experience, I've had a lot of exposure to the business environment. A lot of my courses involved working with real companies to solve real problems




 



By the blessing of god, my family consists of 5 members respectively. My father is an Farmer. My mother is a housewife. My sister who got married And my  brother was completed in Electric Engineering .



That's a great question! You have a slight advantage over me since you know what you're looking for and I am still learning about your company. From what I've learned, it sounds like you are looking for someone who will be able to handle customer concerns quickly and effectively, is that accurate? 

In that case, I'd like to tell you about a time where I handled a customer issue, and they walked away with renewed confidence in our capabilities and services.
