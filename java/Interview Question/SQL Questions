1) What is SQL?

SQL stands for the Structured Query Language. 
It is the standard language used to maintain the relational database and perform many different data manipulation operations on the data.
SQL was initially invented in 1970. It is a database language used for database creation, deletion, fetching and modifying rows, etc. 
sometimes, it is pronounced as 'sequel.' We can also use it to handle organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.
