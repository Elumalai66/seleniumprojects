1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
Selinium: Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at Thought Works. Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.

Different Selenium components: There are Four Selenium components 
                               -> Selenium IDE.
                               -> Selenium RC.
                               -> Selenium WEBDRIVER.
                               -> Selenium GRID.
Selenium WebDriver:  Selenium Webdriver is a collection of open source APIs(Application Programming Interfaces) which are used to automate 
                     the testing of a web applications.It supports many browsers such as Firefox,Chrome,IE and Safari.

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
          
       STEP 1.Selenium Script create an HTTP request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver.
       STEP 2.An HTTP request is then sent to the server using Browser Driver.
       STEP 3.The steps are executed on the HTTP server.
       STEP 4.The execution status is sent to the HTTP server which is then captured by the automation script.
       
3) What are the locators available to find an element using Selenium?
Selenium Locators: There are eight locators in Selenium
                   -> id
                   -> Name
                   -> className
                   -> linkText
                   -> partiallyLinkText
                   -> tagName
                   -> CssSelector
                   -> X-path
                   
Locators are identified by using "By.locators" 

4) Why ID is preferable than X-Path ?
            ID is preferable than Xpath because Id is in a unique .so we are prefer Id than X-path.

5) How to select value in dropdown?
                  Step1:Import Select Package.
                  Step2:Create an Webelement for a required findelement.
                  Step3:Now call a Select class and create a object
                        [Select objectName = new Select();]
                  Step4:Now call the objectName with required Select methods(selectByValue,selectByVisibleText,selectByIndex)
                        [objectName.selectByvalue();]
                        
6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?      
  Absolute Xpath:   
      -> It contains the complete path from the Root Element to the desire element.
     
Relative Xpath: 
      -> This is more like starting simply by referencing the element you want and go from the particular location.
     
     
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not ?[(it is not taught but you can explore)Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html]

		WebElement checkBox = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[text()='Java']//input"));
		checkBox.click();
		
		boolean enabled = checkBox.isEnabled();
		boolean enab = false;
	    if(enabled) {
	    	enab=true;
	        System.out.println(enab);
8) Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager?
         System.setProperty manages the initialization of the Chrome driver in the first step.
          -> setProperty() method forms the basis for test case automation on any browser.
         WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code with a help of pom.xml. 
	        -> We just need to add its dependency through Maven or Gradle to download all the necessary drivers.
 
9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths ?
 Syntax for preceding :
         Elder Sibling Xpath/following-SiblingYounger::tagname
 Syntax for following        
         Younger Sibling Xpath/preceding-SiblingElder::tagname
        
10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
   The getAttribute() method helps to get the value of any attribute of a web element, which is returned as a String. 
	 If an attribute has a Boolean value, the method returns either True or null. 
	 Also, if there is no attribute, the method will return null.
