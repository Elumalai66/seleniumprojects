Difference between High Level Design and Low Level Design : 
S.No.                    	HIGH LEVEL DESIGN	                                                                                LOW LEVEL DESIGN
01.	High Level Design is the general system design means it refers to the overall system design.	     1    Low Level Design is like detailing HLD means it refers to                                                                                                                 component-level design process.
02.	High Level Design in short called as HLD.                                                          2    Low Level Design in short called as LLD.
03.	It is also known as macro level/system design.                                                     3    It is also known as micro level/detailed design.
04.	It describes the overall description/architecture of the application.	                             4    It describes detailed description of each and every module.
05.	High Level Design expresses the brief functionality of each module.  	                             5    Low Level Design expresses details functional logic of the module.
06.	It is created by solution architect.	                                                             6    It is created by designers and developers.
07.	Here in High Level Design the participants are design team, review team, and client team.	         7    Here in Low Level Design participants are design team,                                                                                                                   Operation Teams, and Implementers.
08.	It is created first means before Low Level Design.	                                               8    It is created second means after High Level Design.
09.	In HLD the input criteria is Software Requirement Specification (SRS).	                           9    In LLD the input criteria is reviewed High Level Design                                                                                                                   (HLD).
10.	High Level Solution converts the Business/client requirement into High Level Solution.	           10    Low Level Design converts the High Level Solution into                                                                                                                    Detailed solution.
11.	In HLD the output criteria is data base design, functional design and review record.	             11    In LLD the output criteria is program specification and unit                                                                                                              test plan.
