1. What is TestNG?

TestNG is a testing framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs, from unit testing to integration testing. For more information.

2. What are the advantages of TestNG?


TestNG provides parallel execution of test methods
It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method
It allows to assign priority to test methods
It allows grouping of test methods into test groups
It has support for parameterizing test cases using @Parameters annotation
It allows data driven testing using @DataProvider annotation
It has different assertions that helps in checking the expected and actual results

4. Can you arrange the below testng.xml tags from parent to child?

<test>
<suite>
<class>
<methods>
<classes>
1
2
3
4
5
<test>
<suite>
<class>
<methods>
<classes>
The correct order of the TestNG tags are as follows

<suite>
<test>
<classes>
<class>
<methods>
1
2
3
4
5
<suite>
<test>
<classes>
<class>
<methods>
5. How to create and run testng.xml ? 


In TestNG framework, we need to create testng.xml file to create and handle multiple test classes. We do configure our test run, set test dependency, include or exclude any test, method, class or package and set priority etc in the xml file.

6. What is the importance of testng.xml file?


In a Selenium TestNG project, we use testng.xml file to configure the complete test suite in a single file. Some of the features are as follows.

testng.xml file allows to include or exclude the execution of test methods and test groups
It allows to pass parameters to the test cases
Allows to add group dependencies
Allows to add priorities to the test cases
Allows to configure parallel execution of test cases
Allows to parameterize the test cases
7. How to pass parameter through testng.xml file to a test case?

We could define the parameters in the testng.xml file and then reference those parameters in the source files.


Create a java test class, say, ParameterizedTest.java and add a test method say parameterizedTest() to the test class. This method takes a string as input parameter. Add the annotation @Parameters(“browser”) to this method.

// TestNG Interview Questions
public class ParameterizedTest {
	@Test
	@Parameters("browser")
	public void parameterizedTest(String browser){
		if(browser.equals("firefox")){
			System.out.println("Open Firefox Driver");
		}else if(browser.equals("chrome")){
			System.out.println("Open Chrome Driver");
		}
	}

public class ParameterizedTest {
@Test
@Parameters("browser")
public void parameterizedTest(String browser){
if(browser.equals("firefox")){
System.out.println("Open Firefox Driver");
}else if(browser.equals("chrome")){
System.out.println("Open Chrome Driver");
}
}
}
The parameter would be passed a value from testng.xml, which we will see in the next step.

We could set the parameter using the below syntax in the testng.xml file. 


<parameter name="browser" value="firefox"/>
1
<parameter name="browser" value="firefox"/>
Here, name attribute represents the parameter name and value represents the value of that parameter.

Practical Example

8. What is TestNG Assert and list out common TestNG Assertions?


TestNG Asserts help us to verify the condition of the test in the middle of the test run. Based on the TestNG Assertions, we will consider a successful test only if it is completed the test run without throwing any exception.

Some of the common assertions supported by TestNG are

assertEqual(String actual,String expected)
assertEqual(String actual,String expected, String message)
assertEquals(boolean actual,boolean expected)
assertTrue(condition)
assertTrue(condition, message)
assertFalse(condition)
assertFalse(condition, message)
For Complete Post


9. What is Soft Assert in TestNG?

Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and would continue with the next step after the assert statement.

If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test and test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.


Practical Example

10. What is Hard Assert in TestNG?

Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert statement fails and test suite continues with next @Test


Practical Example

11. What is exception test in TestNG?

TestNG gives an option for tracing the Exception handling of code. You can verify whether a code throws the expected exception or not. The expected exception to validate while running the test case is mentioned using the expectedExceptions attribute value along with @Test annotation.


Practical Example

12. How to set test case priority in TestNG?

We use priority attribute to the @Test annotations. In case priority is not set then the test scripts execute in alphabetical order.


// TestNG Interview Questions
package TestNG;
import org.testng.annotations.*;
public class PriorityTestCase{
	@Test(priority=0)
	public void testCase1() {  
		system.out.println("Test Case 1");
	}
	@Test(priority=1)
	public void testCase2() { 	 
		system.out.println("Test Case 2");
	}

public void testCase1() {  
system.out.println("Test Case 1");
}
@Test(priority=1)
public void testCase2() {
system.out.println("Test Case 2");
}
}
Output:

Test Case 1
Test Case 2
1
2
Test Case 1
Test Case 2
13. What is Parameterized testing in TestNG?

Parameterized tests allow developers to run the same test over and over again using different values.


There are two ways to set these parameters:

using testng.xml – Practical Example
using Data Providers – Practical Example
14. How can we create data driven framework using TestNG?

By using @DataProvider annotation,  we can create a Data Driven Framework.


// TestNG Interview Questions
@DataProvider(name="getData")
	public Object[][] getData(){
		//Object [][] data = new Object [rowCount][colCount];
		Object [][] data = new Object [2][2];
		
		data [0][0] = "FirstUid";
		data [0][1] = "FirstPWD";
		
		data[1][0] = "SecondUid";
		data[1][1] = "SecondPWD";
		
		return data;

data [0][0] = "FirstUid";
data [0][1] = "FirstPWD";
data[1][0] = "SecondUid";
data[1][1] = "SecondPWD";
return data;
}
Practical Example

15. How to run a group of test cases using TestNG?

TestNG allows you to perform sophisticated groupings of test methods. Not only can you declare that methods belong to groups, but you can also specify groups that contain other groups. Then TestNG can be invoked and asked to include a certain set of groups (or regular expressions) while excluding another set.  This gives you maximum flexibility in how you partition your tests and doesn’t require you to recompile anything if you want to run two different sets of tests back to back.


Groups are specified in your testng.xml file and can be found either under the <test> or <suite> tag. Groups specified in the <suite> tag apply to all the <test> tags underneath.

@Test (groups = { "smokeTest", "functionalTest" })
public void loginTest(){
System.out.println("Logged in successfully");
}

@Test (groups = { "smokeTest", "functionalTest" })
public void loginTest(){
System.out.println("Logged in successfully");
}

TestNG Interview Questions 16 – 33
16. How to create Group of Groups in TestNG?


Groups can also include other groups. These groups are called MetaGroups. For example, you might want to define a group all that includes smokeTest and functionalTest. Let’s modify our testng.xml file as follows:

<groups>
   <define name="all">
	 <include name="smokeTest"/>
	 <include name="functionalTest"/>
   </define>
   <run>
         <include name="all" />

<include name="functionalTest"/>
   </define>
   <run>
         <include name="all" />
   </run>        
</groups>
Practical Example

17. How to run test cases in parallel using TestNG?


we can use “parallel” attribute in testng.xml to accomplish parallel test execution in TestNG

The parallel attribute of suite tag can accept four values:

tests – All the test cases inside <test> tag of testng.xml file will run parallel
classes – All the test cases inside a java class will run parallel
methods – All the methods with @Test annotation will execute parallel
instances – Test cases in same instance will execute parallel but two methods of two different instances will run in different thread.

<suite name="softwaretestingmaterial" parallel="methods">
1
<suite name="softwaretestingmaterial" parallel="methods">
Practical Example

18. How to exclude a particular test method from a test case execution? 

By adding the exclude tag in the testng.xml


<classes>
  <class name="TestCaseName">
     <methods>
       <exclude name="TestMethodNameToExclude"/>
     </methods>
  </class>

       <exclude name="TestMethodNameToExclude"/>
     </methods>
  </class>      
</classes>
19. How to exclude a particular test group from a test case execution? 

By adding the exclude tag in the testng.xml

<groups>
    <run>
	 <exclude name="TestGroupNameToExclude"/>
    </run>      
</groups>
1

Practical Example

20. How to disable a test case in TestNG ?

To disable the test case we use the parameter enabled = false to the @Test annotation.

@Test(enabled = false)
1
@Test(enabled = false)
21. How to skip a @Test method from execution in TestNG?


By using throw new SkipException()

Once SkipException() thrown, remaining part of that test method will not be executed and control will goes directly to next test method execution.

throw new SkipException("Skipping - This is not ready for testing ");
1
throw new SkipException("Skipping - This is not ready for testing ");
Practical Example

22. How to Ignore a test case in TestNG?

To ignore the test case we use the parameter enabled = false to the @Test annotation.

@Test(enabled = false)
1
@Test(enabled = false)
Practical Example

23. How TestNG allows to state dependencies?

TestNG allows two ways to declare the dependencies.
Using attributes dependsOnMethods in @Test annotations – Practical Example
Using attributes dependsOnGroups in @Test annotations – Practical Example

24. What are the different ways to produce reports for TestNG results?

TestNG offers two ways to produce a report.

Listeners implement the interface org.testng.ITestListener and are notified in real time of when a test starts, passes, fails, etc…

Reporters implement the interface org.testng.IReporter and are notified when all the suites have been run by TestNG. The IReporter instance receives a list of objects that describe the entire test run.

25. What is the use of @Listener annotation in TestNG?

TestNG listeners are used to configure reports and logging. One of the most widely used listeners in testNG is ITestListener interface. It has methods like onTestStart, onTestSuccess, onTestFailure, onTestSkipped etc. We should implement this interface creating a listener class of our own. Next we should add the listeners annotation (@Listeners) in the Class which was created.

Practical Example

26. How to write regular expression In testng.xml file to search @Test methods containing “smoke” keyword.
Regular expression to find @Test methods containing keyword “smoke” is as mentioned below.
<methods>
     <include name=".*smoke.*"/>
</methods>
1
2
3
<methods>
     <include name=".*smoke.*"/>
</methods>
27. What is the time unit we specify in test suites and test cases? 
We specify the time unit in test suites and test cases is in milliseconds.
28. List out various ways in which TestNG can be invoked?

TestNG can be invoked in the following ways

Using Eclipse IDE
Using ant build tool
From the command line
Using IntelliJ’s IDEA
29. How To Run TestNG Using Command Prompt?

Run the TestNG using command prompt

Open command prompt and use the below code

C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\STMSeleniumTutorial\workspace\SoftwareTestingMaterial

set classpath=C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\STMSeleniumTutorial\workspace\SoftwareTestingMaterial\bin;C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\STMSeleniumTutorial\workspace\SoftwareTestingMaterial\lib\*

java org.testng.TestNG C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\STMSeleniumTutorial\workspace\SoftwareTestingMaterial\testng.xml
30. What is the use of @Test(invocationCount=x)?

The invocationcount attribute tells how many times TestNG should run a test method

@Test(invocationCount = 10)
public void testCase1(){
1
2
@Test(invocationCount = 10)
public void testCase1(){
In this example, the method testCase1 will be invoked ten times

31. What is the use of @Test(threadPoolSize=x)?

The threadPoolSize attribute tells to form a thread pool to run the test method through multiple threads.

Note: This attribute is ignored if invocationCount is not specified

@Test(threadPoolSize = 3, <code class="plain">invocationCount = </code><code class="value">10</code>) public void testCase1(){
1
@Test(threadPoolSize = 3, <code class="plain">invocationCount = </code><code class="value">10</code>) public void testCase1(){
In this example, the method testCase1 will be invoked from three different threads

32. What does the test timeout mean in TestNG?

The maximum number of milliseconds a test case should take.

@Test(threadPoolSize = 3, invocationCount = 10,  timeOut = 10000)
public void testCase1(){
1
2
@Test(threadPoolSize = 3, invocationCount = 10,  timeOut = 10000)
public void testCase1(){
In this example, the function testCase1 will be invoked ten times from three different threads. Additionally, a time-out of ten seconds guarantees that none of the threads will block on this thread forever.

33. What are @Factory and @DataProvider annotation?

@Factory: A factory will execute all the test methods present inside a test class using a separate instance of the respective class with different set of data.

@DataProvider: A test method that uses DataProvider will be executed the specific methods multiple number of times based on the data provided by the DataProvider. The test method will be executed using the same instance of the test class to which the test method belongs.

I would like to conclude this post “TestNG Interview Questions” here.

Final words, Bookmark this post “TestNG Interview Questions” for future reference. After reading this post “TestNG Interview Questions”, if you find that we missed some important questions, please comment below we would try to include those with answers.




Q #1) What is TestNG?

Answer: TestNG is the framework created for executing unit tests in java program by the developers.

TestNG is also used by the software testers to efficiently run the automated test scripts created in Selenium Webdriver. Its full form is the “Testing New Generation” framework.

It is inspired by “JUnit” which is another framework for unit testing Java programs. In addition to all the features in JUnit, TestNG has its new features which make it more powerful.

Q #2) How will you install TestNG in Eclipse?

Answer:

Follow the below steps to install TestNG on Eclipse:

Go to Eclipse -> Click on “Help” -> Click on “Install New Software”.
Click on the “Add” button, Enter the name(Preferably TestNG) in the “Next” textbox. Enter in the “Location” textbox and click on the “OK” action button.
Check the TestNG checkbox and click on the “Next” action button. The installation will start and the Eclipse will restart after installation.
Right-click on the project in Eclipse -> Select build path -> Configure Build Path.
Select the library tab -> Click on Add library button -> Select TestNG-> Click on Next -> Click on Finish and Apply and close.
Q #3) How to run the TestNG script?

Answer:

To run the TestNG script:

Right-click on the class in Eclipse, click on “Run as” and select “TestNG test”.

OR

Directly click on the Run button on the toolbar of the Eclipse.

Q #4) What are the annotations used in TestNG?

Answer: There are three sections of annotation in TestNG:

(i) Precondition annotations: These are the TestNG annotations that are executed before the test.

@BeforeSuite, @BeforeClass, @BeforeTest, @BeforeMethod are the precondition annotations.

(ii) Test annotation: This is the annotation which is only mentioned before the test case (Before the method written to execute the test case)

@Test is the test annotation

(iii) Postcondition annotation: These are the annotations that are executed after the test case. (After the method is written to execute the test case)

@AfterSuite, @AfterClass, @AfterTest, @AfterMethod are the postcondition annotations

Q #5) What is the sequence of execution of the annotations in TestNG?

Answer: The Sequence of execution of the annotations is as follows:

@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@Aftertest
@AfterSuite
Q #6) What are the advantages of TestNG?

Answer: The advantages of TestNG are as follows:

It is an open-source framework, hence it is easy to configure.
Using TestNG we can systematically create the test cases.
It gives lots of annotations which in turn makes the test case creation easy.
Using TestNG, priorities of the tests and the sequence of execution can be defined.
Grouping is possible using TestNG.
It generates HTML reports (Selenium Webdriver cannot generate the test reports alone, it helps SW to achieve this).
Data parameterization is possible using TestNG.
In addition to all the functionalities of JUnit, TestNG has its functionalities, which in turn makes it more powerful.
Q #7) How to set priorities in TestNG?

Answer: There are always more than one test or method in the class. If we do not prioritize these tests or methods, then the methods are selected alphabetically and executed while execution.

If we want to run the tests in the sequence we want, then we need to set the priority along with the @Test annotation.

This can be done as follows:

@Test (priority=1), @Test (priority=2)

Consider the following Example:

@Test (priority=2)
public void getText()
{
driver.findElement(By.id(“id”)).getText();
}
@Test(priority=1)
public void clickelement()
{
driver.findElement(By.id(“id”)).click();
}
In the above example, clickelement() will get executed first as the priority is set to 1.

And, getText() will get executed after clickelement() as its priority is set to 2.

Q #8) How to share the project report using TestNG?

Answer: There are a few ways to do so:

(i) After the execution of the TestNG class, there is one tab called “Result of running class “ which is generated next to the console.

We can copy this and share it.

(ii) After the execution of the TestNG class,

Right-click on the project name and refresh
Click on the “Test-output” folder
Right-click on the “index.html” file and select properties
Copy the link next to “Location”
We can share this link to see the basic HTML test report which is generated by TestNG.

This is the file that gets generated on your machine automatically after the execution of the class using TestNG.

Q #9) How will you define grouping in TestNG?

Answer: We can define grouping in TestNG using groups attribute as shown below:

@Test(groups=”title”)

Q #10) What is a dependency on TestNG?

Answer: There are some methods on which many methods are dependent on.

For Example, If we want to test any application, and if the login page of the application is not working then we won’t be able to test the rest of the scenarios.

So, LoginTest is the method on which many tests are dependent on.

Hence, we will write as follows:

@Test(dependsOnMethods=”LoginTest”)
Public void homePageLaunched()
{
}
The above code shows that homePageLaunched() method is completely dependent on LoginTest() method.


If LoginTest() is passed, only then the homePageLaunched() method gets executed

Q #11) What is InvocationCount in TestNG?

Answer: If we want to execute a test case “n” number of times, then we can use the invocationCount attribute as shown in the below example.

Example:

@Test(invocationCount=8)
Public void print()
{
}
In the above example, the print() method will get executed 8 times.

Q #12) What is timeOut in TestNG?

Answer: If any method in the script takes a long time to execute, then we can terminate that method using “timeout” in TestNG.

@Test(timeout = 5000)

In this case, the method will get terminated in 5000 ms (5 seconds) and the test case is marked as “Failed”.

Q #13) How to handle exceptions in TestNG?

Answer: If there are some methods from which we expect some exceptions, then we can mention the exception in @Test annotation so that the test case does not fail.

Example: If a method is expected to have “numberFormatException” exception, then the test case will fail because of this exception if no try-catch block is specified.

But we can do it in TestNG by using “expectedException” attribute as follows.

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class)

Then the test case will run without failing.

Q #14) What are the common TestNG assertions?

Answer: Common TestNG assertions include:

(i) Assert.assetEquals(String actual, String expected);

It accepts two strings.
If both the strings are equal, the test case executes successfully otherwise the test case fails.
(ii) Assert.assertEquals(String actual, String expected, String message)

It accepts two strings.
If both the strings are equal, the test case executes successfully otherwise the test case fails.
The message is printed if the test case fails.
(iii) Assert.assertEquals(boolean actual, boolean expected)

It accepts two boolean values.
If both the boolean values are equal, the test case executes successfully otherwise the test case fails.
(iv) Assert.assertTrue(<condition(t/f)>)

It accepts a boolean value.
The assertion passes if the condition is True, else an assertion error is displayed.
(v) Assert.assertFalse(<condition(t/f)>)

It accepts a boolean value.
The assertion passes if the condition is False, else an assertion error is displayed.
(vi) Assert.assertTrue(<condition(t/f)>,message)

It accepts a boolean value.
The assertion passes if the condition is True, else an assertion error is displayed with the mentioned message.
(vii) Assert.assertFalse(<condition(t/f)>,message)

It accepts a boolean value.
The assertion passes if the condition is False, else an assertion error is displayed with the mentioned message.
Q #15) How to disable a test in TestNG?

Answer:

To disable a test in TestNG, we have to use the “enabled” attribute as follows:

@Test(enabled=”false”)

Q #16) What are the types of Asserts in TestNG?

Answer: To validate the results (pass/fail), we have to use the assertion.

There are two types of assert in TestNG:

(i) Hard Assert:

Hard Assert is the normal assert which is used to do validations in the TestNG class.

We have to use Assert class for hard assert as follows:

Assert.assertEquals(actual value, expected value);

If the hard assert fails, then none of the code gets executed after the assert statement.

(ii) Soft Assert:

If we want to continue the test execution even after the assert statement fails, then we have to use soft assert.

To create a soft assert, we have to create an object of a “softAssert” class as follows:

softAssert sassert = new softAssert();
sassert.assertAll();

So now if the test case fails, the execution is not terminated when we use soft assert.

Q #17) How to pass parameter in the test case through the testng.xml file?

Answer: If we have a class in which a login method is defined, then we can pass the login parameters to this login method from the testing.xml file

We will have to use the “@parameters” annotation as follows:

@Parameters({"user_name","password"})
@Test
public void loginapp()
{
driverget(“appname”);
driver.findElement(By.id(“login”)).sendkeys(user_name);
driver.findElement(By.id(“password”)).sendkeys(password);
}
Now, go to the testng.xml file and enter the parameters there as follows:

<Suite name = “suitename”>
<test name =”testname”>
<parameter name =”user_name” value=”user1”/>
<parameter password =”password” value =”pass1”/>
<Classes>
<class name =”passingparameters”/>
<classes/>
<test/>
<Suite/>
Q #18) What is the need to create a testng.xml file?

Answer: When we test a project using Selenium Webdriver, it has a lot of classes on it. We cannot choose these classes one by one and put them for automation. Hence we need to create a suite so that all the classes run in a single test suite.

We can achieve this by creating a testing.xml file.

Q #19) How to create an XML file in TestNG?

Answer: Go to the src folder -> click on file ->enter the name of the file(mostly written testing.xml)

Then, Click on finish.

We have a blank XML file. Here, we have to mention the project name and the classes to be executed along with the package name as shown below.

<Suite name = "Testing project">
<test name = "testing feature 1">
<classes>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
<class name = "packagename.name of class1"/>
